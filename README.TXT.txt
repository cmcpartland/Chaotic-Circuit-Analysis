Program: Half-Car Simulation
Version: 1.0

Description==============================================================================

This program is used to analyze the values output by a function that has chaotic behavior. The data is plotted in 5 different ways: a bifurcation plot, a time-domain plot, a Poincare plot, an FFT plot, and a 3D phase portrait. The data comes from a .txt file that is chosen by the user

System Requirements======================================================================

Windows XP and higher
Python 2.7
Pythics: https://code.google.com/p/pythics/

Operation Instructions===================================================================

Install Pythics by finding the program in the downloads section here: https://code.google.com/p/pythics/

With Pythics installed, select File > Open > select the Chaotic_Circuit_Simulation_fastplot.html file. The program will launch. 

Use the file selection boxes to select the bifurcation data file, the parameter file, and the data file.

Choose which plots you wish to see by selecting the check boxes. 

Click the 'Plot RV data' or 'Plot Bifurcation Data' buttons to plot the data.
